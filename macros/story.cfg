In a land beset by harsh weather, where food is scarce and the people are constantly harassed by bands of marauding orcs and undead, the resident elves and dwarves have had to cease their hostilities for the sake of survival. An uneasy truce has formed between these two races, although they have had their differences in the past. For most of the time the truce has been simple; the elves would not attack the dwarves, and vice versa. However, when large war-bands of enemies threaten, the dwarves and elves of the East would create temporary alliances to ward off these foes."
