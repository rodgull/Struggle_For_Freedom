# Terrain overlay types and properties definitions.
# These don't directly affect their rendering in-game. For
# the graphics layout, see terrain-graphics/_final.cfg.
#

#
#
# These three are special overlays that make the
# underlying hex impassable by units with the corresponding
# movement_cost impassable >= unit's MP, usually equals 99.
#
# Gate tiles are intended to be used most of the time with
# the 'Door' (units/mechanical/Door.cfg) unit which automatically
# makes the tile in which it is located passable when killed.
#
# Barrier tiles are intended to be used in maps to have
# some paths initially blocked, but preserving the usual
# terrains' appearance, and let them be removed later by
# WML events.
